## Teaching Assistant, CSC 473 Automata, Grammars and Languages, Aug 2023 - ongoing

I have been working as Teaching Assistant for CSC 473 Automata, Grammars and Languages taught by and under supervision of Prof. Cesim Erten.

- As a Teaching Assistant, I had regular duties like any other student TAs. I think being a TA is chance to continuosly learn and be open to new questions and challenging own comprehension. Not limiting to any point of view.

- I have prior experience working as a Teaching Assistant at University of Colorado Boulder on Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence courses.

- My motto - Theory subjects are fun and interesting so help to make it fun and simpler.
- Its a never-ending learning.

### üèÜAcheivements as a Teaching Assistant

- I proposed ideas to conduct syllabus-driven Supplemental Instruction sessions for practice, add quizzes in-class, idea to accomodate points for piazza questions and answers from students in October 2023 were actually implemented in Spring 2024.

- I planned to continue a studying stress among students for this course to study if the students take advantage of opportunities provided to help them and if that really helps/helped them to reduce stress and improve scores. So I work on this as part of **Teaching as a Research (TAR) course** is part of CIRTL, taught by Instructors Kristin Winet and Byron Richard Hempel and I am grateful for amazing instructors.

- Implementing these ideas is a lot of hard work and I am truly grateful for working with Prof. Cesim Erten.

### My contributions to this course as a Teaching Assistant during Fall 2023:

- **During Fall 2023**, it became a Spiritual quest for me. So at one point there was a question on Left Quotient problem. I quickly found a research paper on this and I had the answer. So I read about Transducers before, so it was easier to connect about Transducers that have an input and output. So I used Transducers to to come up with a transducer-type of solution to **visually explain to the students**.
- Being ready to listen to any type of questions and to help with answers or to seek and/or learn better answers.
- I proactively suggested to reduce heavy weight on homeworks, and suggested to have quizzes and having points/extra credits for piazza questions in Fall 2023 which was part of my Teaching Assistant evaluation form filled on Oct 8th-9th 2023.
 
- **During Fall 2023**, I proactively proposed the idea of **Supplemental Instruction sessions** at the begining of the Fall semester 2023 (which are also the recitations/practice sessions about lectures), as per discussions with Professor.

### My contributions to this course as a Teaching Assistant during Spring 2023:

- **During Spring 2023**, I assimilated some information, to make subject easier and better. I cannot reveal more details about how, what etc since it is within purview of subject and confidentiality per policies.

- **During Spring 2023,** I am parallelly working on attempts reduce stress for students, make this subject fun and to make this simpler. So I requested to extend SI sessions to Spring Semester as well. I learnt from professor to explain in more simpler terms each time.

- My main goal was Theory is fun so I thought others can also benefit looking at the fun side. 
  
- I am presently working on **Teaching as a Research course** project where I am conducting a small study such that to see how better did students do with some additional practice and help - studying stress-levels, from very basic parameters, under minimally guided environment, at University of Arizona. **Teaching as a Research (TAR) course** is part of CIRTL, University of Arizona taught by Kristin Winet and Byron Richard Hempel. Prof. Cesim Erten is also part of this project. I am truly grateful from **TAR** instructors Kristin and Byron and Professor for CSC 473 course: Prof. Cesim Erten.

- This was only possible because **Prof. Cesim Erten** and I worked on the course. I am grateful for the chances to learn more.
