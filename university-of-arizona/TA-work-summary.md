## Teaching Assistant, CSC 473 Automata, Grammars and Languages, Aug 2023 - ongoing

I have been working as Teaching Assistant for CSC 473 Automata, Grammars and Languages taught by Prof. Cesim Erten.

My motto - Theory subjects are fun and interesting so help to make it fun and simpler.

As a Teaching Assistant, I had regular duties like any other student TAs. I think being a TA is chance to continuosly learn and be open to new questions and challenging own comprehension. Not limiting to any point of view.

- I have prior experience working as a Teaching Assistant at University of Colorado Boulder on Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence courses.

- **Prof. Cesim Erten mentored me and I learnt a lot.** It was helpful.

- During pandemic, I learnt about Theory of Computation and Automata theory in depth and types of logics, Formal languages. 
  
- During my TA works, I read research works for most of the assignments questions. This subject involves questions having multiple answers/solutions.
  
- Its a never-ending learning.

### My contributions to this course as a Teaching Assistant during Fall 2023:

- **During Fall 2023**, it became a Spiritual quest for me. So at one point there was a question on Left Quotient problem. I quickly found a research paper on this and I had the answer. So I read about Transducers before, so it was easier to connect about Transducers that have an input and output. So I used Transducers to to come up with a transducer-type of solution to **visually explain to the students**.
- Being ready to listen to any type of questions and to help with answers or to seek and/or learn better answers.
 
- **During Fall 2023**, I proactively proposed the idea of **Supplemental Instruction sessions** at the begining of the Fall semester 2023 (which are also the recitations/practice sessions about lectures), as per discussions with Professor.

### My contributions to this course as a Teaching Assistant during Spring 2023:

- **During Spring 2023**, I assimilated some information, to make subject easier and better. I cannot reveal more details about how, what etc since it is within purview of subject and confidentiality per policies.

- **During Spring 2023,** I am parallelly working on attempts reduce stress for students, make this subject fun and to make this simpler. So I requested to extend SI sessions to Spring Semester as well. I learnt from professor to explain in more simpler terms each time.

- My main goal was Theory is fun so I thought others can also benefit looking at the fun side. 
  
- I am presently working on **Teaching as a Research course** project where I am conducting a small study such that to see how better did students do with some additional practice and help - studying stress-levels, from very basic parameters, under minimally guided environment, at University of Arizona. **Teaching as a Research (TAR) course** is part of CIRTL, University of Arizona taught by Kristin Winet and Byron Richard Hempel. Prof. Cesim Erten is also part of this project. I am truly grateful from **TAR** instructors Kristin and Byron and Professor for CSC 473 course: Prof. Cesim Erten.

- This was only possible because **Prof. Cesim Erten** and I worked on the course. I am grateful for the chances to learn more.
