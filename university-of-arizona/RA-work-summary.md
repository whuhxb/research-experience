# Work as Research Assistant, for a DARPA project, at Clulab, University of Arizona. Aug 19th, 2022 - July 22nd, 2023:

This works are evidences of great collaboration with Prof. Mihai Surdeanu and Dr. Enrique Noriega Atala. 
The main goals were to learn scala, Odin rules system. We cannot reveal many details of the "what" and "how".

1. I worked on developing on an small module existing software written in scala. I learnt to implement modules in scala.

2. I worked on a tasks involving text extraction from Covid papers using a well-established software pipeline implemented by experts. 

3. I annotated datasets for this task in 2.
   
5. It was nice project all good stuff must come to an end.

## My contributions based on my findings for the RA work, not implemented, but seemed fun to me

Here although most of the tasks were well directed, I had some interesting findings of my own, following are my ideas but remain unexplored, that I contributed and I wanted to share, for the love of language, historical newspapers and Abstract Meaning Representations:

### Jan 9th 2023

  a) I found out that lot of Out-of-vocabulary words existed. This was expected since Covid introduced several new terms and words. So I proposed to extract new vocabulary by appealing to neologisms. Linguistic analysis of neologism related to coronavirus (COVID-19) https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590291121000978  Oxford as well as Cambridge maintained neologisms for Covid. The apis gave both new words and word senses related to Covid.
  **This one for the love of language.**

### Feb 6th 2023

  b) I also identified that in Covid papers, which came from different types of document structures, based on conferences/paper formats. The context and text organized was heavily dependent on structure and headings, which was even very different from AI/NLP conference papers and structure (sections, etc). So I referred to **my works from my Independent study from University of Colorado Boulder at Digital Slavery Research Lab**. I studied about Impresso project which is Historical news paper texts and Named entity extractions project, which is available at: <a href="https://github.com/sushmaakoju/named-entity-text-extraction-ocr-slave-trade-volumes/blob/main/README.md#historical-newspapers-data-studied-under-digital-humanities-hipe-identifying-historical-people-places-and-other-entities">Historical newspapers data studied under Digital Humanities: HIPE (Identifying Historical People, Places and other Entities)</a>.
  **This one for the historical newspaper and their lasting impressions.**

### Mar 18th 2023

  c) I found some interesting works on Abstract Meaning Representation extended to document-level structures. 
  My idea is similar to other known approaches in Historical or OCR scanned documents: 
  label the segments and related Regions of Interests (ROI) like a sentence-span, paragraph spans to keywords/events. 
  **This one for the "Abstract Meaning Representation" of Martha Palmer.**
  The following works were nice works but I never got a chance to implement or explore.
  
  - <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.00241.pdf">A Two-Stream AMR-enhanced Model for Document-level Event Argument Extraction<a>
  - <a href="https://aclanthology.org/C18-1313.pdf">AMR Beyond the Sentence: the Multi-sentence AMR corpus</a>

### Summer 2023

  d) We did not implement c) exactly, but after guided review, we had a different strategy as per supervision from Prof. Mihai Surdeanu. My aforementioned three ideas remain unexplored.
