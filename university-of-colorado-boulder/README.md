# University of Colorado Boulder Sep 2021 - July 2022

Masters in Data Science:

**Not everyone likes to give up the comfort of a well-earning job to study and do research. If a research interest to help a good cause arises, what can ever go wrong with learning and studying?**

I explored various forms of explainability and interpretability towards complex, black-box-style Deep Learning models.
This is because, a lot of students and people, were in a deep-learning rush and looking at the types of millions of jobs just so focussed on Deep Learning and over-estimated use of such models. I thought learning and finding "interpretability" and "explainability" in the deep learning models was not this hard. It was nevertheless surprising that a majority of industry jobs race towards deep learning models without actually even being worried about interpretability and explainability or even backward verification of results in downstream or upstream tasks for production release in the industry. We spend so much time writing design testing, prototype testing, unit testing, functional testing, regression testing, usability, and many more types of testing that I am not really familiar with. Something must have been really promising to use Deep Learning models, even without having rough, "approximated" clarity or accounting from the output end (results) all the way back to the input data in a complex network. There were both advantages and disadvantages. I am certainly not an expert but I wanted to find out. I explored trying to address the same using logic and various following directions.

1. First by <a href="https://github.com/sushmaakoju/research-experience/blob/main/university-of-colorado-boulder/sushma-akoju-Interpretability_explainability.pdf">comparing traditional statistical methods and their simplicity, explainability with that of unexplainable deep learning models</a>.
2. Second by exploring <a href="https://github.com/sushmaakoju/research-experience/blob/main/university-of-colorado-boulder/sushma-akoju-KRR%20Project%20Final%20Presentation.pdf">StrategyQA, EntailmentBank from Allen AI Institute's datasets and research papers, then by studying Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) and Logical Neural Networks</a> and <a href="https://github.com/sushmaakoju/research-experience/blob/main/university-of-colorado-boulder/sushma-akoju-mln-stats-fall-2021-final.pdf">Markov Logical Networks</a> and <a href="https://github.com/sushmaakoju/research-experience/blob/main/university-of-colorado-boulder/sushma-akoju-Theorem%20Prover.pdf">Automated Theorem prover</a>.
3. Third, by understanding state-of-the-art Natural Language research towards Logic and Reasoning.
4.

5. Also explored philosophical and ethical requirements for industry-driven tasks using Deep Learning models and AI. There are pros and cons to the Ethics in Data Science course, CU Boulder (final course project reports not included here).
6. Need for generalization and abstractions versus domain-specific, task-oriented AI pipelines in Data Science and Data Analysis such as <a href="https://github.com/sushmaakoju/nlp-bio-bert">Biomedical text corpus during NLP course</a> and <a href="https://github.com/sushmaakoju/research-experience/blob/main/university-of-colorado-boulder/sushma-akoju-task4-final-project-assignment.pdf">SemEval Task 4 Patronizing and Condescending Language Detection (PCL) - ranked 1 in first round</a>.

## Courses and Course Projects: Towards Logic and Reasoning in Language

### 7. Big Data Architecture, ATLS 5241: Gregory Greenstreet, Brian Newsom, Spring 2022

This project is for demonstrating the concepts from the Big Data Architecture class: Google Cloud and industry best practices for deployment. This was part of the Big Data Architecture course during my Masters in Data Science at the University of Colorado Boulder, Spring 2022. The Big Data Architecture course only focuses on deployment, cloud environments, and developing APIs along with industry best practices.

#### My research goal and learning goals 
It was an exploratory self-study to learn about Theorem Provers and Turing Completeness. - Self-learning goal.

## 8. Independent Study, Prof. Henry Lovejoy : Study and design of NER & Text extraction from OCR scanned Handwritten Slave Trade Volumes

I worked on an Independent Study supervised by Prof. Henry Lovejoy for the Digital Slavery Research Lab, at the University of Colorado, Boulder. It was towards the study and design of Named Entity Recognition from OCR scanned Handwritten Slave Trade Volumes and to train a search over OCR scanned documents. The goal was to analyze and emancipate people from the present impressions of the past: <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/lab/dsrl/collaborators"></a>.

### Code repository for this project
<a href="https://github.com/sushmaakoju/named-entity-text-extraction-ocr-slave-trade-volumes">Independent Study:  Study and design of NER & Text extraction from OCR scanned Handwritten Slave Trade Volumes (British Parliamentary Papers) </a>

### Summary Reports of the study and approach for the Independent Study

- <a href="https://github.com/sushmaakoju/research-experience/blob/main/university-of-colorado-boulder/sushma-akoju-independent-study-digital-slavery-first_summary_report.pdf"> First report: study and design of Named Entity Extraction from OCR scanned Handwritten Slave Trade Volumes and to train a search over OCR scanned documents<a/>

- <a href="https://github.com/sushmaakoju/research-experience/blob/main/university-of-colorado-boulder/sushma-akoju-digital-slavery-project-indep_study_final_report.pdf"> Second report: study and design of Named Entity Extraction from OCR scanned Handwritten Slave Trade Volumes and to train a search over OCR scanned documents<a/>

- The challenge here was that Named Entity Recognition needs to run over the text extracted from the 19th-century English language text corpus. Performance over BERT under zero-shot settings was poor for 80% of the vocabulary. So we used <a href="https://github.com/sushmaakoju/macberth-eval">MacBERTh</a> model.
